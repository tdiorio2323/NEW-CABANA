## Post-Demo

### Audience Questions

**Q: "Is this using a real backend?"**
A: "No, it's 100% client-side mock data. Every API call goes to an in-memory store. Watch..." [open browser DevTools → Network tab, show no requests]

**Q: "Can I try it?"**
A: "Absolutely! The demo panel lets you switch personas instantly. Here, let me show you." [hand keyboard/mouse]

**Q: "How do you keep mock data in sync with production?"**
A: "Great question. Our types are shared between mock and production, so TypeScript enforces the contract. The mock API has the same interface as the real API."

**Q: "What if I want different data?"**
A: "Just change the seed!" [demonstrate seed change → reset]

**Q: "Does it work on mobile?"**
A: "Yes! Let me resize..." [shrink browser window to 390px width]
